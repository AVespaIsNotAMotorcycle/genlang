### Sentence Structure

The too most common sentence structures in the world are SVO and SOV, with VSO being pretty uncommon. The problem is that languages often use multiple sentence structures depending on context. In German subordinate clauses, the word order is *usually* SOV, although it can be OVS. However, the default order is either OVS or SVO. In English relative clauses can change order as well ("The food *that he eats* is expensive."). I think what I'll do is have a default order, as well as several situations like relative clauses, questions, and subordinating conjunctions which *can* have alternate order.
